  <h2>Social Network and Social Media Analysis (National Taiwan University, 2024)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Focus:</strong> Analysis of online fan discourse and genre-based polarisation through the Taylor Swift–Kanye West feud, exploring stereotypes, parasocial relationships, and civility across pop and rap communities.
  </p>
  <p> 
    <strong>Methods:</strong> Mixed-methods approach combining sentiment classification via transformer models and ChatGPT API; manual sampling and cleaning of YouTube comments; categorisation of fan discourse into supportive, neutral, and critical classes; word frequency analysis and visualisation; civility and name-calling classification using zero-shot and fine-tuned models; temporal and engagement metrics to assess discourse dynamics.
     </p>
  <p> 
    <strong>Deliverable:</strong> Seminar paper examining online fan polarisation, genre-linked toxicity, and the influence of song-specific messaging in music-based social media interactions.

      <h2>Political Economy of Cross-Strait Relations (National Taiwan University, 2025)</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Focus:</strong> Analysis of why China’s economic leverage over Taiwan—through strategies like trade dependency, tourism restrictions, and agricultural import bans—has failed to influence Taiwan’s political direction. The paper investigates China’s attempts at coercive economic statecraft, the limits of asymmetric interdependence, and the resilience of democratic societies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Methods:</strong> The research uses a literature review on economic statecraft, applies theories of interdependence and coercion, and conducts case studies of recent Chinese actions (e.g., tourism suspension, pineapple ban, ECFA threats). It also compares Taiwan’s response to China with those of South Korea and Australia, examining the political and economic outcomes through document and data analysis.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Deliverable:</strong> A seminar paper critically assessing why China’s economic coercion strategy has not succeeded with Taiwan, highlighting the roles of domestic identity, political institutions, alternative partnerships, and the diminishing effectiveness of economic leverage in rivalrous, democratic contexts.
